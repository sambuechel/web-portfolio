<p>This webpage is showing the projects I completed throughout the semester and the process and ideas behind them. The 2 projects feature a soundscape narrative and visual argument. Each project used different editors and I will go through each to show my knowledge on both applications and the tools used within them.</p>
<h2>Soundscape Narrative</h2>

<p>The soundscape narrative was created using Audacity. By using different audio files from FreeSounds online, I was able to put them all together to create a short horror narrative. It takes the listener through different parts of a story. Beginning with knocking on the door, footsteps running, and glass breaking. It leaves a lot up to the imagination but is able to clearly paint a picture in the listener's mind.</p>

<h2>Visual Argument</h2>

<p>The visual argument was designed and created in Gimp. This app works like photoshop and I was able to use different tools and layers to create  my narrative. The argument and message being conveyed in this piece is that environmental waste is affecting many regions around the world as well as the animals in it. A lot of campaigns only focus on the turtles and the ocean but there are so many other animals suffering the consequences of trash waste.</p>
